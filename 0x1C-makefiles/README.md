## Project: Learning Makefiles

Welcome to the Learning Makefiles project! In this project, i will dive into the world of Makefiles, a powerful tool for automating software builds. Through a series of tasks, you will gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how Makefiles work.

### Resources

Before you start, it's recommended to review the following resources:

- [Makefile Introduction](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)
- [Installing the make utility](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [GNU Make Official Documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)

### General Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc Version: 9.3.0
- make Version: GNU Make 4.2.1
- Files must end with a new line
- A mandatory README.md file at the project's root folder

### Task Overview

The project consists of several tasks, each designed to enhance your understanding of Makefiles. Below is a brief description of each task:

#### Task 0: Introduction to Makefiles

In this task, you'll create your first Makefile. The Makefile will compile source files into an executable named "school".

#### Task 1: Using Compiler and Source Variables

You'll improve the Makefile by using variables for the compiler and source files. 
This task reinforces the importance of using variables for maintainability.

#### Task 2: More Advanced Makefile

This task takes you further by introducing object files and utilizing them to recompile only updated source files. 
You'll also avoid maintaining a list of all object files.

#### Task 3: Enhanced Makefile with Cleaning Rules

Building on the previous task, you'll create a Makefile with rules for cleaning up temporary and object files. 
This task emphasizes the importance of well-structured Makefiles.

#### Task 4: Complete Makefile with Compiler Flags

You'll create a complete Makefile that includes compiler flags. This task demonstrates how to use flags for better code quality and debugging.

#### Task 5: Island Perimeter Calculation (Python Script)

Finally, you'll step into a Python scripting task. You'll implement a function to calculate the perimeter of an island based on a given grid.

### Repository Information

The GitHub repository "alx-low_level_programming" contains the necessary files for each task in the "0x1C-makefiles" directory. 
Follow the instructions in each task's respective Makefile or script file.

Enjoy your journey of learning and mastering Makefiles!
