##Search Algorithms Project

##Overview

This project is all about search algorithms implemented in C. The goal is to explore and understand different search techniques, 
such as linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, and exponential search.

##Tasks

Implement Algorithms: Write C functions for each search algorithm mentioned above.
Time and Space Complexity Analysis: Analyze and compare the time and space complexity of the implemented search algorithms.
